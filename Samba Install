Install Samba:

apt install samba nano

Add to /etc/samba/smb.conf:

[Test]
  comment = test
  path = /home/josh/samba
  browseable = yes
  read only = no
  guest ok = no
  valid users = josh

[global]
server max protocol = SMB3
smb encrypt = required
lanman auth = no

 ;this makes encryption required (it’s interesting to look at Wireshark before and after).

Create the josh samba user:
smbpasswd -a josh
Give permissions to /samba to the josh samba user:
chown -R josh:josh /samba
Then restart Samba:
systemctl restart smbd
Samba will run on port 445 on the server.

“If this is set to mandatory then all traffic to a share must must be encrypted once the connection has been made to the share. The server would return "access denied" to all non-encrypted requests on such a share. Selecting encrypted traffic reduces throughput as smaller packet sizes must be used (no huge UNIX style read/writes allowed) as well as the overhead of encrypting and signing all the data.”
